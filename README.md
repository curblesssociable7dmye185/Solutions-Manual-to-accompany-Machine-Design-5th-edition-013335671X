  * Machine Design presents the subject matter in an up-to-date and thorough manner with a strong design emphasis. This textbook emphasises failure theory and analysis as well as the synthesis and design aspects of machine elements. The book points out the commonality of the analytical approaches needed to design a wide variety of elements and emphasises the use of computer-aided engineering as an approach to the design and analysis of these classes of problems.
 
  * Teaching and Learning Experience
 
  * To provide a better teaching and learning experience, for both instructors and students, this program will:
  * * Apply Theory and/or Research: An integrated, case-based approach to Machine Design.
    * * Engage Students: Examples and industrially relevant case studies demonstrate the importance of the subject, offer a real-world perspective, and keep students interested.
